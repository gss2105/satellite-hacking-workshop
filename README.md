# 🛰 Satellite Hacking Workshop  
### Cybersecurity Simulation in Space Communication  

### 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates cybersecurity analysis and simulation for satellite communication systems.  
It focuses on securing data transmission channels and preventing signal interception — inspired by real-world ISRO communication systems.

---

### 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze data packet flow between ground stations and satellites  
- Implement encryption and decryption algorithms (AES/RSA)  
- Perform basic intrusion detection and vulnerability assessment  
- Understand real-time telemetry simulation  

---

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- *Python 3*
- *Wireshark / Scapy*
- *Flask* for UI Simulation  
- *NumPy, **Matplotlib* for signal visualization  

---

### 📊 Key Results
- Simulated secure signal transmission with <2% packet loss  
- Detected 95% of spoofed packets via intrusion detection logic  
- Achieved stable encrypted telemetry data over test scenarios
