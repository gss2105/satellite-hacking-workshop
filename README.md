# 🛰 Satellite Hacking Workshop

### 🔒 Overview  
*Satellite Hacking Workshop* is a cybersecurity-focused project that explores vulnerabilities in space communication systems and proposes mitigation methods for data protection and signal security.

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Understand how satellite data transmission works.  
- Identify key security vulnerabilities.  
- Suggest preventive strategies using ethical hacking and secure encryption.  

### 🧠 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Wireshark / Scapy for packet analysis  
- Data encryption (AES, RSA concepts)  

### 🚀 Key Learnings  
This project helped me explore how cybersecurity principles can be applied to satellite communication systems — a domain very relevant to ISRO’s data security goals.
